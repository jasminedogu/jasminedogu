### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jasmine Dogu, and I recently graduated from the University of Virginia as a Statistics major and a Data Science minor. I'm passionate about all things machine learning related. Outside of work, I am a spin instructor at Cyclebar. I love seeing people grow and achieve their personal fitness goals.
