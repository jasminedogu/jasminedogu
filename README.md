### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Jasmine Dogu, and I graduated from the University of Virginia as a Statistics major and a Data Science minor. Throughout my academic journey, Iâ€™ve discovered a deep passion for Computer Science and Statistics, which has led me to get involved with Data Science. Iâ€™m specifically interested in Machine Learning, Data Mining, and Data Visualization; Iâ€™m excited to get the opportunity to apply these interests into various fields. I believe that my perpetuous success stems from my commitment to always ask questions and dedication to incessantly pursue new challenges.

Outside of work, I am a Spin instructor at Cyclebar. I love seeing people grow and achieve their personal fitness goals.
